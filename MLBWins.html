								<h1 class="major">Predicting MLB Wins</h1>
								<span class = "fix"><img src = "images/Stadium.jpg" alt = ""/></span>
								<p>This project uses data found on <a href="https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/">Lahman's Baseball Database</a>. The goal of the project is to use team statistic totals to predict the number of wins that the team will have in the season. This will then allow us to see the statistics that are most important in predicting a team's win total. A sample of the team statistics are shown below:</p>
								<span class = "fix"><img src="images/TeamTotals.png" title="Sample of Team Total Data Set" /></span>
								<p>The features selected for the regression need to be limited as to not use the same information multiple times. For example, if hits, at bats, and average are all used for the regression, then hits is taken into account twice as the equation for batting average is hits divided by at bats. Hits allowed and walks issued was condensed to WHIP and earned runs was condensed to ERA to account for games that went into extra innings. Additionally, saves and shut outs were excluded as both indicate a win along with complete games as a complete game by a pitcher indicates a high probability of winning. In the case of RBIs and runs scored, both were included as RBIs account for intentional offense and total runs take unearned runs into account. In the case of fielding statistics, only errors and double plays turned were included. The complete list of features used to predict wins is as follows:</p>
								<span class = "fix"><img src="images/X_train.png" title="Sample of Features Data Set" /></span>
								<p>The model created was created with a base of XGBRegressor from python's <a href = "https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">XGBoost</a> package. Regression problems use features to predict a continuous target (in our caseâ€”win total). XGBRegressor gives access to hyperparameters that can be set to change how the model learns. Knowing the values to set these hyperparameters to is done with a metric in mind. The metric in this case is known as the model's R-squared. A models R-squared value is the percent of the variation in the data that is accounted for by the model. More on regression and the analysis thereof can be found <a href = "Regression.html"> here</a>. To find the values to set the hyperparameters to, a grid search is used to optimize the R-squared value. A grid search runs the model with each combination of user supplied lists of values for the hyperparameters selected. After manipulating the hyperparameters, an R-squared of .855 was achieved.</p>

								<p>The distribution above shows how the wins of the test data compare to the predicted wins. The remaining .145 of the distribution that is not accounted for by the model is believed to be accounted for by immeasurable human factors (anything from jitters to a player feeling under the weather). Overall, the model predicted over half of the teams win totals within three games of their actual win total. Additionally, certain years were removed as outliers, such as the Mariners 116 win season (when included, their season resulted in the biggest difference between predicted wins and actual wins with only 104 predicted wins).</p>
								<span class = "fix"><img src = "images/MLBImportance.png" alt = "K-scores" title = "Feature Importance"></span>
								<p>Looking at the importance of the selected features in the regression's training, the top five features were: runs, WHIP, RBIs, ERA, and hits. Pitchers' strike outs and striking out as a batter were two of the lowest features in importance. Additionally, home runs, one of the most highlights statistics for a batter is only eighth on the list of importance. Using regression to predict the number of home runs per game for a team to win X number of games, there is a small increase of home runs per game for each increase of ten wins between 70 and 100, but only around one home run per game is predicted for a team that wins 70 games and 100 games. This further shows that home runs are not an important feature in predicting wins.</p>
								<span class = "fix"><img src = "images/RegressionStats.png" title = "Predicted Stats Versus Wins"></span>
								<p>Looking at the means for teams winning X number of games can also be telling. These plots show the mean for each instance of games won in a season (between 60 and 110 wins). If a feature were important, there would be a clear slope in the plots. Home runs per game, however, is the most sporadic and flat of the plots shown.</p>
